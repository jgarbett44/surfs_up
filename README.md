# **Surf's Up**

## *Overview*

We have a business plan for an ice cream/surf shop on the island of Oahu; however, one major investor is worried about the weather. To satisfy his concerns, we performed analytics on a weather data set.

## *Results*

* The average (mean) temperature in June is 75 degrees and the average temperature in December is 71 degrees.

* The average high temperature in June is 85 degrees and the average temperature in December is 83 degrees.

* The greatest temperature difference between June and December is the minimum, from 64 degrees in June to 56 degrees in December.

## *Summary*

To summarize, the weather is warm and dry in Oahu year-round, with the greatest chance for rain in the spring and in the fall. There is a 4 degree difference in the average temperature between June and December, so there is not much change from summer to winter. It should make an ideal location for an ice cream/surf shop.
