# Surfs Up

## Overview

We have a business plan for an ice cream/surf shop on the island of Oahu; however, one possible investor wants to know more about the weather. To satisfy his concerns, we performed analytics on a weather data set.

## Results

* The average temperature in June is 75 degrees and the average temperature in December is 71 degrees, so there is not much change from summer to winter

* The high temperature in June is 85 degrees and the average temperature in December is 83 degrees

* The greatest temperature difference between June and December is the minimum, from 64 degrees in June to 56 degrees in December.
